#Garmin Bluetooth iOS Fixes

##Part one: Fixes to Garmin Connect not being available
- The first step is to launch the Garmin Connect app everytime you respring or reboot your device.
- After that the tweak will disable your bluetooth for 5 seconds and then reenable your bluetooth.
  - This causes all the notifications to be resent to your watch (this is mainly enabled just for resprings but can be good for after boot as well)
- Lastly the tweak will create a push notification to your phone only letting you know your watch is ready to be used.

##Part two: Garmin Connect App Modifications
- Music controls on your watch will now universally control any source of music including Spotify, Pandora and Youtube.
- Music controls now include the fancy volume buttons that Android users already have.
- More to come as I see fit.
